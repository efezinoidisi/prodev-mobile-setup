# Overview

Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To ensure a smooth development experience, we will be using the Expo Framework for React Native, which simplifies mobile app development and testing.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:

- Node.js LTS installed
- VS Code (recommended IDE)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows OS
- Expo Go installed on your physical device (Android or iOS)

### Why Expo Go?

Unlike web development, mobile development relies on device emulators to test applications. However, keeping up with the ever-evolving mobile ecosystem (e.g., iPhone 7 â†’ iPhone 16 Pro Max, various Android devices) can be costly in terms of hardware requirements.

Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by allowing you to test and run your React Native applications directly on your physical device, supporting both iOS and Android seamlessly.

## Steps to Install Expo Go

1. Visit the official Expo Go homepage: https://expo.dev/go.

2. Select the latest SDK version.

3. Click on Install for your device:
   Android: Install from the Google Play Store.
4. iOS: Install from the Apple App Store.

5. Open the Expo Go app on your device.
   Create a new account or log in if you already have one.
