# Introduction to React Native

## Overview

React Native is an open-source framework created by Facebook that allows developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript/TypeScript and React. Unlike traditional mobile development frameworks that rely on platform-specific languages like Swift (iOS) and Java (Android), React Native enables you to write a single codebase that can run on both iOS and Android devices.

### Key Features of React Native:
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Write once, run anywhere. React Native code can run on both iOS and Android platforms with minimal adjustments.

- **Native Components**: React Native provides a library of components that map directly to native UI components, ensuring that your app feels like a native app.

- **Hot Reloading**: React Nativeâ€™s hot reloading feature allows developers to instantly see the results of their code changes without restarting the entire app.

- **Extensive Ecosystem**: React Native has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools that make mobile development faster and easier.

### How React Native Works
React Native uses JavaScript/TypeScript to build mobile apps but differs from traditional hybrid frameworks like Cordova or Ionic, which render web-based content within a WebView. Instead, React Native compiles to native code, allowing the app to render native UI components directly. This approach provides better performance and a more authentic user experience.
